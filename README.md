# Heightmap
application which builds an efficient data structure for quickly looking up ground elevation at a given lat/lon from a large DEM file

For my internship with D-Vision systems. It was later re-written in C++ but I don't have access to that code.
My next assignment from them wasn't fully completed before the end of the internship, but it was an NMEA message decoder/encoder written in C++
for spoofing as a basic GPS hardware device and can be found here: [NMEA-Encoding-Tool](https://github.com/MEECAH/NMEA-Encoding-Tool)
